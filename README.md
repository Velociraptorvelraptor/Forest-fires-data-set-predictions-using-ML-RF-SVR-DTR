# Forest fires data set predictions using machine lerning methods

Project contains three methods boosted using GridSearch:
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest
with evaluated comparison of particular method errors.

Data source: [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

Following project is the continuation of [setting up Apache Spark cluster tutorial](https://github.com/Velociraptorvelraptor/AWS-EC2-instances-Spark-cluster-configuration-with-Jupyter/blob/master/README.md)\n
Jupyter notebook is set up on master node of Apache Spark two nodes cluster (Amazon Web Services).
Data set is hold in AWS S3 bucket and downloaded directly from there.
